              <p>Slide 4</p>
              <p>The technology behind blockchain data stores and workflows has been around since the 1990s. 
                Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation</p>
              <p>In 1991, two scientists, trying to store data so that no one could make changes to it retroactively, created the first prototype of the future technology. 
                These developers were programmer Stuart Habert and physicist Scott Stornett</p>
              <p>In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym used by an individual or group of individuals) 
                published a document on the Internet called Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.</p>

              <p>Each block contains some data, the hash of
                the block and the hash of the previous block</p>
              <p>The data that is stored inside a block depends

              <p>The Bitcoin blockchain for example stores
                the details about a transaction in here, such
                as the sender, receiver and amount of coins</p>

              <p>A block also has a hash. It identifies a block and all of its contents
                and it's always unique</p>

              <p>The third element inside each block is the
                hash of the previous block.This effectively creates a chain of blocks
                and itâ€™s this technique that makes a blockchain so secure</p>

              <p>Slide 11</p>
              <p>Here we have a chain of 3 blocks.As you can see, each block has a hash and
                the hash of the previous block</p>

              <p>So block number 3 points to block number 2

              <p>Slide 13</p>
              <p>Now the first block is a bit special, it cannot point to previous blocks because 
                it's the first one. We call this the genesis block</p>

              <p>Now let's say that you tamper with the second block. 
                This causes the hash of the block to change as well</p>
              <p>In turn that will make block 3 and all following blocks invalid because 
                  they no longer store a valid hash of the previous block</p>

              <p>It's a mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks. In Bitcoins case: it takes about 10 minutes
                to calculate the required proof-of-work and add a new block to the chain</p>
